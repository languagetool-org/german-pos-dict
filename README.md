german-pos-dict
===============

A German part-of-speech dictionary that can be used from Java. This repo contains no code
but [Morfologik](https://github.com/morfologik/) binary files to look up part-of-speech data.
As a developer, consider using [LanguageTool](https://github.com/languagetool-org) instead
of this. If you really want to use this directly, please check out the unit tests for examples.

Also use LanguageTool to export the data in these dictionaries, [as documented here](https://dev.languagetool.org/developing-a-tagger-dictionary#exporting-the-data).

The POS tags are documented [here](https://danielnaber.de/download/wklassen.pdf).

## Internal

If you update the tagger dictionary, always make sure to also update the synth dictionary
with the same data and vice versa. LanguageTool expects the two to be in sync.

To prepare a release (note this will only *add* forms, not remove them):

* (optional) move readings from [do-not-synthesize.txt](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool/blob/master/languagetool-language-modules/de/src/main/resources/org/languagetool/resource/de/do-not-synthesize.txt) to `filter-archaic.txt` (in the execution path of SynthDictionaryBuilder)
* call `./download-data.sh`
* set `DBUSER`, `DBPASS`, and `LT_PASS` in `./data-to-dict.sh`
* call `./data-to-dict.sh`
* increase version in `pom.xml`
* call `mvn install`
* test it from the software that integrates it (including a regression test)

To make a release:

* set the version in `pom.xml` to not include `SNAPSHOT`
* `rm src/main/resources/org/languagetool/resource/de/SynthDictionaryBuilder*tags.txt`
* `mvn clean test`
* `mvn clean deploy -P release`
* go to https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories
* scroll to the bottom, select latest version, and click `Release`
* `git tag vx.y`
* `git push origin vx.y`
